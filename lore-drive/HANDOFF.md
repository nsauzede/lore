# HANDOFF

## 1. Setup

Firstly, apply RUST.md to correctly setup the required Rust toolchain.
(the workspace uses edition 2024 which requires Rust ≥ 1.85):

Verify the workspace root `Cargo.toml` references `lore-drive` in `members` —
it already does as of the commit that accompanies this HANDOFF.

## 2. Tasks (see below)

Then I want you to perform the tasks not yet done in below Tasks section.
For that you need to clone <https://github.com/nsauzede/lore.git> and checkout branch f-drive
(be smart and remove any local/previous `lore` destination path!).

## 3. Check

Nothing to do for now.

## 4. Update project

Then I want you to update the present HANDOFF.md + any other relevant documents to reflect the current state of the project,
for your future self to take over new tasks I'll append here (mark as done those which are to keep this HANDOFF clean & maintainable).
The step 1 (eg: Rust, maybe Sveltekit) shall always be instructed because of peculiar AI's sandbox constraints wrt Rust.
Eg: if you face any crates version issue in Cargo.toml, please find a working crate set and update it too. Use "=x.y" if required etc.
Add all your work in a new git commit (use your identity !) then `cargo clean` and create a ZIP archive of the whole project + git history and present
it as downloadble archive file.
Don't hesitate to enhance this HANDOFF.md if need be.

# Tasks

- [ ] **Attempt a first build + smoke-test** — Now that the `LORE_CONTEXT` panic is
      fixed, set up a full build environment (see RUST.md + install `protoc` since
      lore-base/lore-revision pull in tonic/prost which need the protobuf compiler),
      then run `cargo build -p lore-drive` and address any remaining compile errors.
      If `protoc` is not available via apt (`apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler`),
      document the blocker and leave build notes here.
      After a successful build, point the binary at a real lore workspace and verify:
      - `curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/info` returns JSON without panicking.
      - `curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tree` returns the root listing.
      - `curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/node/1` returns a valid node record.

- [x] **Fix startup panic** (`cannot access a task-local storage value without
      setting it first`) — Root cause: `load_and_connect` (and every lore verb)
      calls `execution_context()` which reads from a tokio task-local
      (`LORE_CONTEXT`). The previous `main.rs` called `load_and_connect` directly
      in the async main body with no task-local set.
      **Fix applied in `lore-drive/src/main.rs`:**
      - Extracted the entire workspace-open sequence into a new
        `open_workspace(workdir)` async fn.
      - Before calling it, create a startup `ExecutionContext` with
        `EventDispatcher::no_dispatch()` (no callback needed for init).
      - Wrap the call in `LORE_CONTEXT.scope(startup_ctx, open_workspace(...))`.
      - Added imports: `lore_base::runtime::LORE_CONTEXT`,
        `lore_revision::interface::ExecutionContext`,
        `lore_revision::relay::EventDispatcher`.
      - Per-request handlers are unaffected — they already get their own
        `LORE_CONTEXT` scope via the internal `revision_tree_call`/`storage_call`
        dispatch helpers inside the lore crate.

- [x] **Scaffold `lore-drive` app** — Create `lore-drive/src/main.rs` (and any
      needed `src/*.rs` modules) implementing the three endpoints specified in
      `REST_API.md`.  The implementation requirements are:

      **Bootstrapping**
      - Binary entry-point: `lore-drive/src/main.rs`
      - Bind on `0.0.0.0:8080` by default; accept an optional `--port` CLI arg.
      - Use `#[tokio::main]` with the multi-thread runtime.
      - Emit structured logs via `tracing_subscriber` (env-filter, JSON optional).

      **State**
      - At startup, open the lore workspace from the current working directory.
        Use `lore::repository::RepositoryContext` (or the equivalent high-level
        `lore` crate API) to load the repo, detect the active branch and its
        latest committed revision hash, and build a `LoreRevisionTree` handle
        (via `lore::revision_tree::load::load`).
      - Wrap the loaded state in `Arc<AppState>` and inject it via `axum::Extension`.

      **Endpoints** (see REST_API.md for full shapes):
      - `GET /api/v1/info`  → JSON workspace metadata (repo id, branch id/name, revision, workdir).
      - `GET /api/v1/tree?node_id=<u64>` → JSON listing of a directory's direct children;
        default to ROOT_NODE when `node_id` is absent or 0;
        use `lore::revision_tree::list_children::list_children`.
      - `GET /api/v1/node/:node_id` → JSON node record including path from root;
        use `lore::revision_tree::node_info::node_info` and
        `lore::revision_tree::node_path::node_path`.

      **CORS**
      - Attach `tower_http::cors::CorsLayer::permissive()` so the future SvelteKit
        frontend on a different port can reach the API in development.

- [x] **Design REST_API.md** — Produced `lore-drive/REST_API.md`: a rigorous
      specification of the three read-only endpoints (`GET /api/v1/info`,
      `GET /api/v1/tree`, `GET /api/v1/node/:node_id`) that expose the workspace's
      revision tree.  Identity types (Hash/Context/Partition/Address/NodeID)
      are mapped 1-to-1 from lore-base to JSON with no re-encoding.
      Also: updated `lore-drive/Cargo.toml` with real dependencies (axum, tokio,
      tower-http, serde, serde_json, lore-base, tracing) and added `lore-drive`
      to the root workspace `Cargo.toml` members + workspace.dependencies.
